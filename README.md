## Hi there! :wave:

My name is Monica and I am a 27 year-old front-end developer based in Sandnes, Norway.

I have a Bachelor's degree in Marketing Management from BI - Norwegian Business School and I am currently taking a higher professional degree in Frontend Development at Noroff - School of Technology and Digital Media.

As a front-end developer, I am passionate about creating intuitive and engaging user experiences. In addition to my strong skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I also have experience in photography, digital marketing, and graphic design. This diverse range of skills allows me to bring a unique and well-rounded perspective to my work. I am constantly seeking to learn and stay up-to-date with the latest technologies and industry best practices. In my past projects, I have successfully utilized my skills to create clean and efficient code that meets both the needs of users and the requirements of the project. I am excited to continue honing my skills and delivering exceptional front-end development work.
